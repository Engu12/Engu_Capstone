Categorizatioins of flight delays 

How are these categories defined?

Air Carrier: The cause of the cancellation or delay was due to circumstances within the airline's control 
(e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.).
Extreme Weather: Significant meteorological conditions (actual or forecasted) that, in the judgment of the carrier, 
delays or prevents the operation of a flight such as tornado, blizzard or hurricane.
National Aviation System (NAS): Delays and cancellations attributable to the national aviation system that refer to 
a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control.
Late-arriving aircraft: A previous flight with same aircraft arrived late, causing the present flight to depart late.
Security: Delays or cancellations caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach,
 inoperative screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.
