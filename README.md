1)Introduction 

This capstone project is for the analysis work on the US major airlines performance data_set and 
to come up with a certain conclusion to answer how COVID 19 affected the On-Time 
Performance (OTP)?

Various scenarious could disrubt the airline's operation 

Air Carrier: The cause of the cancellation or delay was due to circumstances within the airline's control 
(e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.).
Extreme Weather: Significant meteorological conditions (actual or forecasted) that, in the judgment of the carrier, 
delays or prevents the operation of a flight such as tornado, blizzard or hurricane.
National Aviation System (NAS): Delays and cancellations attributable to the national aviation system that refer to 
a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air 
traffic control.Late-arriving aircraft: A previous flight with same aircraft arrived late, causing the present flight
to depart late.Security: Delays or cancellations caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of 
aircraft because of security breach,inoperative screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at 
screening areas.

2)Data question or Minimum Viable Product (MVP)from this capstone 

   - Which US major airlines are dirctely or inversely affected on thier OTP ,during COVID?
   - How the states/airports with in the states graph looks like in terms of the OTP?
   - How the KPI (OTP) is on the four selected months ?


2)Data Extraction, Exploration,  

Data explored ,extraced , cleansed, remapped and imported into the visualization platform on selected sampling
two set of data taken before the onset of COVID and during COVID

For This Capston Data is extracted form the offical web from The United States Department of Transportaton and Bureau of
Transportation Statistics

3)Data samping 

  For this analysis task I choose only four months of data ( two before COVID and two during COVID)

  1)August-2019 Monthly Airliner performance Data
  2)February_2020 Monthly Airliner performance Data
  3)August_2020 Montly Airlines Performance Data
  4)February_2021 Montly Airlines Performance Data


4)Methodologies used in this capstone project 

  data cleansed and remapping was done using Python and Some advanced Excel data cleanseing technizques

5) Findinings and Data visualization used 

   Most Airlines are getting green in terms of the OTP during COVID Panedemic
   Data Visualization is done with Tableau
